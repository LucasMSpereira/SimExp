# SimExp
The goal of this project was to experiment with advanced simulation techniques, such as topological optimization, constitutive models, S-FEM, mesh generation algorithms, meshless/particle methods, hybridization with AI, etc.

Through the year of development of this project, I started my master's degree. I also got a better sense of how much scientific computing is being developed by the Julia community. This project was a great starting point for me, but I'll try to reach the goals mentioned above by using what the Julia community has to offer, instead of reinventing the wheel.

The technological starting point and main source of information for this project is the book "Programming the Finite Element Method" (I. M. Smith et al, 5 ed., Wiley) and its fortran code.
