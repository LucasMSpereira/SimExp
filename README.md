# SimExp

This was an initial project to get used to Julia and review the fundamentals of FEA (linear structural 2D/3D). Final updates included topological optimization for 2D cases.

The technological starting point and main source of information for this project is the book "Programming the Finite Element Method" (I. M. Smith et al, 5 ed., Wiley) and its fortran code.
