# SimExp
The final goal of this project is to experiment with advanced simulation techniques, such as topological optimization, constitutive models, S-FEM, mesh generation algorithms, meshless/particle methods, hybridization with AI, etc.

It's by no means an attempt to compete with industry-level software, but rather a curiosity exercise and an opportunity to learn along the way.

The technological starting point and main source of information for this project is the book "Programming the Finite Element Method" (I. M. Smith et al, 5 ed., Wiley) and its fortran code.
